A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/allanpope/pen/OVJWLK.

 Svg memory game built to practice my writing something in JavaScript. Tiles are svg's which morph into icons using Snap.js.

Couple of the icon transitions could be smoother by tweaking where the square points on the SVG are located. 

Icons are from Wojciech Zasina's Organic Food Icon Set(http://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/03/19/freebie-organic-food-icon-set/) .
